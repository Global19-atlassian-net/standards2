# NCBI Web Design Standards

[NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ncbi-web-standards)


The National Center for Biotechnology information (NCBI) is 
beginning work on a substantial website redesign. This repository
contains the UI components developed to support that activity.

The NCBI is a U.S. government agency that collects, analyzes,
and distributes scientific data and associated biomedical 
literature. It is part of the U.S. National Library of 
Medicine located within the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The new NCBI standards are built on the foundation of the
<a href="https://standards.usa.gov/">U.S. Web Design Standards</a> (USWDS). The aim of the USWDS to improve consistency across federal websites and achieve better experiences for the Americal public.
